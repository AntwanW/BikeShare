# BikeShare
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this challenge is to create a bike trip analysis. This tutorial will use Pandas to convert the trip duration column to a DateTime datatype. Weâ€™ll then develop a set of visualization tools that will show you the various elements of the trip duration.

 - The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
 - The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
 - The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results:

## Summary:
The analysis states that many of these users may not be tourists but commuters, as most peak times are around morning and evening commutes. Most of the users were males; this can be useful in marketing campaigns.
